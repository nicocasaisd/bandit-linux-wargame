## Archivos Hexdumps

Hexdumps are often used when we want to look at data that cannot be represented in strings and therefore is not readable, so it is easier to look at the hex values. A hexdump has three main columns. The first shows the address, the second the hex representation of the data on that address and the last shows the actual data as strings (with ‘.’ being hex values that cannot be represented as a string).
